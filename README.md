## Qcar SLAM
python code for use with the Quanser Q car.

# SLAM Overview
SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. SLAM algorithms are notorious for being a "chicken and egg" problem, knowing your position in a map that is empty is very difficult.  

# Implementation
We are solving the problem with a grid based fastSLAM algorithm


Code is appropriated from a simulation for use in the real world on the Qcar, github for the simluation is below.
